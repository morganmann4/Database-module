# Overview

For this project I wanted to learn how to use sql. I used the sqlite library in pythonto create a database and add data to tables.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}

# Relational Database

The relational database I created was a database containing movies and their genres. I also created a database with directors and the movies they have directed.

# Development Environment
 
 I used python and sqlite to create my database and tables.
